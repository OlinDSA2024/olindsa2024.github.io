## Hello Kotlin!

Go through [the Kotlin tour](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-welcome.html).  Make sure to attempt all of the exercises in the tour.

1. What features do you like about Kotlin?
2. Are there things you were expecting to find that you haven't?
3. What questions do you have?


> Turning in your work: You don't have to turn in the code you write for the tour.  Please let me know that you did indeed finish the tour and turn in your answers to the questions above.

## Translating Your Old Code to Kotlin

Choose a piece of code that you've written in a programming language other than Kotlin.  Translate the code to run in Kotlin.  For simplicity, you may want to choose some code that will not require interacting with a lot of external libraries.  Let me know if you want advice on this code.

The code you produce should be documented and contain at least some unit tests.

>  Turning in your work: Include a link to a Github repo containing your port of the code.  Include a writeup that describes the purpose of the code and how you found the process of translating the code to Kotlin (the good, the bad, and the ugly).
