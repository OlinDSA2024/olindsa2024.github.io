## Overview

This assignment is all about implementing, benchmarking, and solving problems with sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithm Implementation and Complexity Analysis

Implement at least four of the following sorting algorithms.  For each sorting algorithm you implement, provide an analysis f its computational complexity.  At least one of your algorithms should be $\Theta(n \log n)$.
* Heap sort
* Radix sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Merge sort

## Sorting Algorithm Benchmarking

Test the performance of your sorting algorithms on sorting different sized lists of numbers.  Present your conclusions as part of a writeup.

## New Frontiers in Sorting?

Do some research to determine what new problems exist in terms of sorting.  Is this a solved problem or is there a new frontier to discover?

## Turning in your Code

Submit a link to a repository that has your code and writeup.  Make sure to add me ``paulruvolo`` as a collaborator if the repo is private.

## Assessment

See the rubric on Canvas.
