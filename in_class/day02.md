## Continuing with our whirlwind tour of algorithm development patterns

Gas station problem

Algorithm fun fact

## O() and Friends

$$f(x) = O(g(x))$$ if there exists a positive real number $$M$$ and a real number $$x_0$$ such that,
$$
\begin{align}
|f(x)| \leq M g(x)~~\mbox{for all}~~x \geq x_0
\end{align}
$$

$$f(x) = \Omega(g(x))$$ if there exists a positive real number $$M$$ and a real number $$x_0$$ such that,

$$
\begin{align}
|f(x)| \geq M g(x)~~\mbox{for all}~~x \geq x_0
\end{align}
$$

We say that $$f(x) = \Theta(g(x))$$ if $$f(x) = O(g(x))$$ and $$f(x) = \Omega(g(x))$$.

## Programming Language Taxonomy

TODO

## Work on Kotlin Basics

We'll take some time to work on the assignment.  This will give us a chance to discuss Kotlin, figure out bugs with your environment, etc.
