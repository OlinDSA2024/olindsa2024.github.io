## Course Structure and Major Topics

The goal of this course is for you to learn how to frame problems formally and ultimately select appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve them.  We'll get more into what we mean by framing problems later (there is an example later today), but for now I want to focus on the sorts of problems we will be tackling and the algorithmic strategies we will be using to solve them.

### Data Structures

* Data structures as supports for algorithms.  Ultimately, data structures are useful to solve certain problems.  There are a number of properties we might care about when we select a data structure.  Can we brainstorm some as a class?
* We'll be learning about basic linked data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues), data structures to represent graphs, and tree-based data structures (e.g., binary search trees or heaps).

## Peak Finding

> Credit to MIT Open Courseware 6.006 for this problem

Suppose we have a list of numbers represented as a sequenece $$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$ with $$n \geq 2$$.  For any element that isn't either the first or the last element of this sequence, we say that element $$i$$ is a peak if and only if $$a_i \geq  a_{i-1}~\mbox{and}~a_i \geq a_{i+1}$$.  For the elements at the ends of the sequence, we say that $$a_1$$ is a peak if and only $$a_1 \geq a_2$$ and $$a_n$$ is a peak if and only if $$a_n \geq a_{n-1}$$.
