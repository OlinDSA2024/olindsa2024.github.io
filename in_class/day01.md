Suppose we have a list of numbers represented as a sequenece $$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$ with $$n \geq 2$$.  For any element that isn't either the first or the last element of this sequence, we say that element $$i$$ is a peak if and only if $$a_i \geq  a_{i-1}~\mbox{and}~a_i \geq a_{i+1}$$.  For the elements at the ends of the sequence, we say that $$a_1$$ is a peak if and only $$a_1 \geq a_2$$ and $$a_n$$ is a peak if and only if $$a_n \geq a_{n-1}$$.
