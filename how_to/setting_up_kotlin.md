## Install IntelliJ IDE

We'll be working with the [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org/) (more information and history of the language available [through Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)).  The best way to get Kotlin for your computer it install the IntelliJ IDE by JetBrains.  While you can use other IDEs with Kotlin (e.g., VS Code), we strongly recommend you stick IntellIJ (as that is the official IDE for Kotlin).  You can get a free license for Jetbrains since you are part of an academic institution.

The [Getting Started page](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html) on the Kotlin website is the place to go to get started on your journey.  As you go through the instructions, make sure to click on the link that says ``IntelliJ IDE``.
