## Install Jetbrains IDE

We'll be working with the [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org/).  The best way to get Kotlin for your computer it install the Jetbrains IDE.  While you can use other IDEs with Kotlin (e.g., VS Code), we strongly recommend you stick Jetbrains (as that is the official IDE for Kotlin).  You can get a free license for Jetbrains since you are part of an academic institution.
